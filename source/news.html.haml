      Only 18 to 20 percent of engineers across the U.S. are women, and only 18 percent of those studying to be engineers in universities are women, according to a recent article published by American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Those statistics motivated Schindler, now a senior at Duke, to found Girls Engineering Change in summer 2012, a nonprofit organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in engineering...

      "Duke University's engineering labs are usually quiet on the weekends. But on a recent Saturday morning, a chorus of middle-schoolers raised the decibel level throughout the wing. As a group of undergraduate engineering majors watched on, we all began to smile - our physics-weary faces brightened by the sounds of tween girls learning how to solder..."
