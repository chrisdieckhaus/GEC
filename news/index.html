    <p class='article-blurb'>
      Currently, GEC has reached over 500 girls, primarily in central North Carolina. But that's not enough! We're looking to expand even further. We'd like to form Girls Engineering Change chapters on at least four universities across the country, and we need your help to do so. Please consider donating by clicking

    </p>
    <p class='article-blurb'>
      Only 18 to 20 percent of engineers across the U.S. are women, and only 18 percent of those studying to be engineers in universities are women, according to a recent article published by American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Those statistics motivated Schindler, now a senior at Duke, to found Girls Engineering Change in summer 2012, a nonprofit organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in engineering...

      "Duke University's engineering labs are usually quiet on the weekends. But on a recent Saturday morning, a chorus of middle-schoolers raised the decibel level throughout the wing. As a group of undergraduate engineering majors watched on, we all began to smile - our physics-weary faces brightened by the sounds of tween girls learning how to solder..."

      "'...Many of the young female innovators and change-makers focus their efforts and energies on using their STEM knowledge to solve a particular challenge, sometimes to expand STEM opportunities for others. Just take Christine Schindler, a Duke University undergrad who emerged from CGI U last year as an engineering evangelist. Christine made a CGI U 2012 Commitment to Action pairing female engineering students at Duke with teenage girls in Durham...' - Chelsea Clinton"

      "A mentor would have made Duke University student Christine Schindler even more sure she wanted to pursue biomedical engineering in college, the sophomore hypothesizes. Now fully enmeshed in her studies, which she says are constantly exciting and clue her into new career possibilities frequently, Schindler hopes to provide support to young women that she once lacked..."
